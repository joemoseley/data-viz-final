      <h1>An Analysis of Title 1 Eligible Schools in Chicago</h1>
      <h3>by: Joseph Moseley</h3>
      <p>Title 1 is a federally funded educational program providing extra funds to schools that enroll a large percentage of low income students. Schools enrolling over 40% low income student are eligible for these extra funds. Percentage of low income students is determined by the number of students enrolled in the free lunch and reduced lunch programs. The funding is designed to help schools meet the educational goals of low income students.</p>

        <h2>Map of High Schools</h2>

        <p>This map shows title 1 eligible high schools in the city with informational tooltips showing total enrollent, percentage of low income students, and average performance on standardized tests. There are fewer high schools because they are able to reach many more neighborhoods and have fewer low income students. Usually giving them enough to not qualify for Title 1 funding.</p>

        <p>Simmilar to the above map, this map shows the same information for Title 1 eligible elementary schools. There are many more elementary schools because of lower enrollment and most elementary schools are neighborhood schools.</p>
